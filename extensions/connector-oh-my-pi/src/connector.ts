 * The oh-my-pi connector: launches an embedded Cotal peer that runs the oh-my-pi
 * coding-agent SDK loop and answers mesh traffic as a lateral peer. Inbound drives the
 * loop directly (prompt to wake, steer to interject mid-turn). Forwards the launcher's
 * identity + minted creds so the peer authenticates as `id` under auth. Self-registers on
 * import; the manager resolves it by agent type "oh-my-pi".
 *
 * oh-my-pi (https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) is a fork of Pi, so this mirrors the `pi`
 * connector but targets `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`; the divergences the fork introduced
 * (e.g. retries surface as session `auto_retry_*` events, not an `agent_end.willRetry`
 * flag) are handled in `peer.ts`.
