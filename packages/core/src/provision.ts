/**
 * The provisioner — the signer capability for a space.
 *
 * A space is one NATS *account*; every agent is a *user* in it. This module mints the
 * decentralized-JWT trust chain (operator → account → user) programmatically with
 * `@nats-io/jwt`, so there is no dependency on the external `nsc` CLI and the signing
 * key stays in one place (whoever holds {@link SpaceAuth.account.signingSeed}).
 *
 * Demo-1 stage: out-of-band mint. `cotal up` creates the space's trust material
 * once and writes a `nats-server` config (operator + system account + MEMORY resolver);
 * `cotal mint` and the manager load that material and mint per-agent creds files. There
 * is no connect-time token exchange yet (that's the later auth-callout stage).
 *
 * D5 adds the first credential-death primitive: profile-classified user-JWT lifetimes. Full revocation,
 * live eviction, standing-host renewal, and issuance audit still land in later D5 slices.

  // the connection (the client retries forever — a connect that "hangs"). Raise it to fit a rich
  // agent JWT — but right-sized, not generous: the CONNECT line is parsed BEFORE auth, so the cap
  // is a per-connection pre-auth allocation under connection flooding. 64 KB clears a many-channel
  // agent JWT (~4–8 KB) with wide margin while keeping the pre-auth surface ~16× tighter than 1 MB.
